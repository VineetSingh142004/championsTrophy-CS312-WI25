# Champions Trophy Winner Prediction Model

## 1. Introduction
The **Champions Trophy Winner Prediction Model** is a machine learning project aimed at forecasting the winner of the ICC Champions Trophy tournament based on historical data from 1998 to 2025. The objective of this project is to analyze past tournament results and various performance metrics to build predictive models that estimate the likelihood of a team winning the tournament.

## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset consists of records from the **Champions Trophy tournaments held between 1998 and 2025**. It includes various features such as:
- Team statistics (batting and bowling averages, past performance, ranking, etc.)
- Match outcomes (win/loss)
- Head-to-head records
- Tournament stage data (group stage, knockout rounds, final, etc.)
- Additional contextual factors (venue, weather conditions, etc.)

The dataset has been preprocessed and structured to facilitate effective model training and evaluation.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values by using interpolation and mean imputation.
- Encoding categorical variables such as team names and match venues.
- Normalizing numerical features to improve model efficiency.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

### 3.2 Feature Engineering
- Derived additional statistical metrics from available data.
- Extracted historical performance trends to enhance predictive capabilities.

## 4. Model Implementation
Multiple machine learning models were implemented and evaluated for their predictive performance, including:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM)**
5. **Neural Networks (ANN)**

Each model was trained on historical data and tested using cross-validation to determine accuracy and robustness.

## 5. Results & Analysis
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC Score**


## 6. Conclusion & Future Work
The Champions Trophy Winner Prediction Model successfully predicts tournament winners based on historical data. Future enhancements could include:
- Integrating real-time match data for dynamic predictions.
- Incorporating advanced deep learning models.
- Expanding feature selection to include sentiment analysis from news and social media.

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in sports analytics and provides a strong foundation for future predictive models in cricket tournaments.
